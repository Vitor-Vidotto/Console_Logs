For using the application make shure the port is the same of your project
and test it using the insomnia or some app of your preference
to thest the get you only need to run the project with node src/server.js
and open http://localhost:3000/ on your navigator
after that to teste the post, create a post on insomnia and use this url
http://localhost:3000/testepost and make the post in json format
and be happy
i only copyed the project from a video "como salvar log em arquivo das requisições node js com morgan"
